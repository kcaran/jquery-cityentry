chosen-example
==============

This is an example using Chosen, a jQuery plugin that makes select boxes more user-friendly. For Massachusetts and New Hampshire, 
the user selects a city from a dropdown list. For all other states, they can free-key the city. The example also uses the jQuery 
validator plugin for validation.
