jquery-cityentry
================
This is a jQuery plugin for selecting a state and city.  For Massachusetts
and New Hampshire, the user selects a city from a dropdown list. For all
other states, they can free-key the city. 

The plugin relies on Chosen, a jQuery plugin that makes select boxes more user-friendly.  It also uses the jQuery Validation plugin for validation.
